# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning Classification)

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using multiple supervised machine learning algorithms.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build classification models that predict passenger survival based on features such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Passenger Class
- Fare
- Number of siblings/spouses
- Port of embarkation

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is loaded from the Seaborn library:

```python
sns.load_dataset("titanic")
